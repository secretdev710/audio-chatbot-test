transcription = "An audio chatbot is a voice-enabled AI that allows users to interact using speech instead of text. It uses speech recognition to convert voice to text, NLP to understand intent, and text-to-speech (TTS) to respond with audio. Popular services include Google Speech-to-Text, Amazon Polly, and OpenAIâ€™s Whisper. These bots are used in virtual assistants, customer support, smart homes, and healthcare. They integrate with APIs for real-time responses and can be built using frameworks like Dialogflow or Rasa. Developers use React Native, Flutter, or web apps for the frontend. The key challenge is ensuring accurate speech recognition across different accents and environments."

response = "A cross-platform mobile app developer specializes in building applications that run on both iOS and Android using a single codebase. They typically work with frameworks like React Native, Flutter, or Xamarin to create efficient and scalable apps. Their role involves designing user-friendly interfaces, optimizing performance, and integrating APIs for seamless functionality. They ensure compatibility across different devices and operating systems while maintaining a native-like experience. Debugging and testing on multiple platforms are crucial to delivering a smooth user experience. Collaboration with designers and backend developers helps in building feature-rich applications. Their expertise allows businesses to reduce development costs and time while reaching a broader audience."
